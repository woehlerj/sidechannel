* Bug: a buffer overflow, with a timing sidechannel to smartly leak the canary

canary successful:
  usleep(500000);
  write(client_sockfd, "Thank you for submitting feedback\n", 34); 

canary failed:
  void __stack_chk_fail(void) {
      write(4, "Thank you for submitting feedback\n", 34);
      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
  }


* Exploit

  1) leak canary by smartly bruteforcing it using the timing sidechannel
  2) read out flag by using ROP gadgets and read / open / write
