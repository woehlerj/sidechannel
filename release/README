Our most favorite local coffee shop has created a form for feedback. This feedback needs to be written somewhere - but they might have been a bit a bit mean with the storage space for it. What happens if we exceed it? Does it really behave exactly the same?

Hint: The flag is stored in /flag

Hint 2: Is there a difference in behaviour between a "legal" input and a long input?
